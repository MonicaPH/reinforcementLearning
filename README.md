This repository is highly inspired from [Denny Britz RL repo](https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning) contains
solutions to exercise from the book and from the David Silver's RL course. Link to both resources:

- [David Silver's Reinforcement Learning Course](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html)
- [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf)
